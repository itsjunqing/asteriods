                <h2>Asteroids Gameplay Introduction</h2>
                <p>Rocket is given 5 lives. Upon firing each asteroids, player will be awarded with scores,<br> where the scores are based on the destroy of large or small asteroids.<br>Destroying larger asteroids will grant the player higher score and smaller asteroids for lower score.<br>Higher scores will ultimately lead to higher level.<br>At each increment of level, asteroids will move at a faster rate, so beware of your keys!<br>When level 3 is reached, a boss will be spawned from the top, this boss will follow the rocket at all times.<br>If the rocket collides with the boss or the asteroids, the number of lives will be reduced, and the gameplay will be reset.</p>
                <p>>> Killing large asteroids with bullets will spawn smaller asteroids and only smaller asteroids can be destroyed fully.</p>
                <p>>> To detonate a bomb, press the 'B' button and the bomb will be spawned on the location of the rocket.<br>This bomb will exist for 10 seconds before it completely disappears into the air.<br>The bomb will only explode when the enemy boss is nearby, and if it is, the enemy's health will be reduced by 1.<br>When the health reaches zero, the enemy is destroyed</p>
                <h2>Leveling System</h2>
                <p>Each level will be increased when the score reaches above 1000 * current level.<br>For instance, when at level 1, level 2 will be achieved when score is 1000 (1000 * 1).<br>At level 2, level 3 will be achieved when score is 2000 (1000 * 2).<br>This leveling system applies for all levels.</p>
                <h2>How To Play</h2> 
                <ol>
                    <li>ArrowUp Key <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-up"></i>: To move/thrust the rocket forward (BEWARE OF SPEEDING, you may collide with asteroid! use ArrowDown to stop moving!)</li>
                    <li>ArrowDown Key <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i>: To stop moving/thrusting the rocket forward (to reduce speed / stop moving)</li>
                    <li>ArrowLeft Key <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-left"></i>: To rotate to the left</li>
                    <li>ArrowRight Key <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>: To rotate to the right</li>
                    <li>Space Key <i class="fas fa-crosshairs"></i>: To fire bullets</li>
                    <li>B Key <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i>: To detonate bomb (only for killing enemy boss)</li>

                <h2>How To Kill</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>For asteroids: Kill them with bullets by pressing 'Space' key</li>
                    <li>For enemy boss: Kill them with bombs by pressing 'B' key, which will reduce the enemy's health <br>(Hint: the goal is to move around the map, spawn bomb and nudge them to move over the bomb, because the boss will follow you!)<br></li>
